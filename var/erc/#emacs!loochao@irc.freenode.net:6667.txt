<youlysses> Is there a automated way to convert my .odt documents to org-mode,
            and/or other documenting based services/languagus?
<tali713> hey, and many times there are aspects of the law were I would like
          more consistency.  like I think that corporations, being persons
          after all, should have to serve jail time and be unable to conduct
          business after accidentally killing thousands of people.  just like
          if I am drunk and hit a guy while driving a car.
<ijp> tali713: and liquor stores should not be allowed to sell alcohol until
      they have been in business 18/21 years :P                         [13:18]
<shergill> exactly. meaning either do away with the 'corporations are people'
           analogy entirely, or codify a better analogy.
<shergill> don't do neither, and rely on human discretion *every* time
<Frozenlock> tali713: Why the distinction between hitting someone with your
             car and hitting someone with your car while drunk?         [13:19]
<tali713> oh, nah, i'm in favor of metaphorically jailing them.  if you kill
          people being a corporation shouldn't mean, well it doesn't matter,
          here is a fine that's half of one days net profit.

<JordiGH> How does one pull a Ron Jeremy?
<Frozenlock> tali713: Taking alcohol increases the risk. However the risk
             variation isn't the same for everyone. Some are sober and
             represent the same risk as others who've taken some shots. Should
             driving for them also be criminal? How do you determine this? Can
             you universalize this principle? -> increase of risk = criminal?
<ijp> JordiGH: by the d**k                                              [13:25]

<fsbot> Ba-dum, *Ching!*
<tali713> Frozenlock: if they kill someone, yes.  end of story.         [13:26]
<Frozenlock> But until then, no, is that right?
<tali713> Frozenlock: their state of mind effects the nature of the killing,
          regardless, it is a killing.
<ijp> Frozenlock: you make guidelines about reasonable alcohol consumption
      based on expected average tolerance                               [13:27]
<Frozenlock> I agree. Which is why I don't see why whether or not they've
             taken alcohol should matter.
<tali713> Frozenlock: irrelevent to the case at hand.  I was using vehicular
          manslaughter as an example.  your driving ability is not at hand
          here.  your willful disregard for life is.

<tali713> Frozenlock: because it isn't vehicular murder if you didn't mean to
          kill the victim.  if you are drunk, odds are, it was an accident.
                                                                        [13:28]
<ned> punishing people for drunk driving is the equivalent of thoughtcrime 
<youlysses> Compaines are only "people" when they view it to be more
            preffrable to the law they must "adhere" to.
<ned> (i'm 80% joking, but somewhat serious)
<proq> what about search engine crime?                                  [13:29]
<ned> what's that? punishing people for looking up things that could
      potentially faciliate a crime?
<ijp> ned: okay, so how is reckless endangerment of others using heavy
      machinery a thoughtcrime?
<Frozenlock> tali713: Perhaps I misunderstood what you were saying, I thought
             you wanted a drunk driver to have different consequences than
             anybody else.
<tali713> Frozenlock: just like if you are are a drug company, and you decide
          that it is an acceptable risk to put an unsafe drug on the
          market. (by advertsining for a pupose other than what it was tested
          for), you aren't intending to kill people, it's just the consequence
          of the actions.
<ned> ijp: until you actually do some damage it's punishing people for
      potential damage rather than actual damage
<ijp> ned: the mere fact that you've actually got drunk, and got in a car, is
      an actual act                                                     [13:30]
*** pgega (~pgega@5ad7c217.bb.sky.com) has quit: Quit: Konversation

<ned> yes i agree with that but that act isn't inherently causing damage
<tali713> ned: the same argument could be made for headlights.
<offby1> when I say PATH=/some/dir:$PATH, is there an easy way to ensure that
         /some/dir doesn't also appear _later_ in $PATH?  I often find my PATH
         has multiple copies of directories, like
         /some/dir:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/some/dir:/usr/share/bin:/some/dir
         etc
<ned> tali713: and safety belts
<ned> actually, i withdraw the safety belt quip, that's not even remotely
      analogous                                                         [13:31]
*** julienfantin (Adium@nat/hackerschool.com/x-nzbzqynpkvjrxaqp) has quit:
    Quit: Leaving.
<tali713> ned: not really, the only people effected by safety belt usage is
          the occupent of the vehicle.  headlights are not just for you.
          driving in a predictible manner is not just for you.
<ned> yeah i withdrew that argument ;]                                  [13:32]
<tali713> yup, saw that.
*** jmd` (~user@de.cellform.com) has joined channel #emacs
<tali713> the thing is, you won't be arrested for driving drunk if you show no
          signs.  but if you do show highly erratic driving, and you are
          drunk, then your choice to get drunk and get in the vehicle is
          certainly a problem. (crime or not)                           [13:33]
*** kevinbenko (~kvirc@misterfluffy.dsl.xmission.com) has quit: Quit: KVIrc
    4.1.3 Equilibrium http://www.kvirc.net/
<ijp> ned: I could see how that would be an argument against checkpoints, but
      if you were noticed by a passing officer, they probably aren't going to
      stop you unless you are driving in an uncoordinated (and therefore
      dangerous) manner
<proq> Frozenlock: the drunk driving law is one of those cases where it
       doesn't really matter what an individual's opinion about the law is.
       it's other people's lives at stake, and disagreeing is pretty selfish
<ijp> ah, tali713 beat me to it
<Frozenlock> So don't drive at 20 km/h if you're drunk, it might be
             suspicious. Go at 50-60 km/h instead :P                    [13:34]
<ned> ijp: i support pulling people over for lane violations, erratic driving,
      and speeding regardless of whether or not theyre under the influence
<tali713> don't drive unsafely ever, and if your judgement is impaired (the
          first sign being that you are convinced your judgment is not
          impaired), then you can't drive safely, it requires reflexes you
          don't have.

<ijp> ned: okay, but you don't think that being under the influence should be
      a factor in deciding the appropriate punishment?                  [13:36]
<daveo> in some ways, a drunk driver killing someone (regardless of intent) is
        far worse than the the planned murder, the victum is not guilty of any
        offense                                                         [13:37]
<daveo> innocent bystander
<ijp> daveo: but the murdered person totally had it coming?
<shergill> daveo: what makes you think the victim has to be guilty of anything
           in planned murder?
<Frozenlock> proq: Don't associate law and preferable behavior. I would not
             drive drunk. I just think treating drunk driver differently is
             incoherent. (And the law should be coherent/understandable for
             Joe Sixpack to be able to follow it. Saying otherwise is pretty
             selfish ;-)  )
<tali713> ned: those aren't the bad part of drunk driving, those are the
          observable parts.  the lack of reaction time is the truly dangerous
          part.  you might be able to handle normal circumstances, but driving
          doesn't gaurentee those and you need to be able to react almost
          instantaniously.  I also think talking on a cellular is equivalent
          and should be punished equivalently.
<ned> ijp: you can't use being drunk as an excuse to justify your crime in
      defense in order to diminish the sentence issued post conviction. the
      converse should be true -- i.e., your punishment shouldn't be increased
<proq> Frozenlock: 38% of traffic fatalities in 2009 were from drunk driving
       accidents                                                        [13:38]
<ned> tali713: should you punish old people who have demonstratably lowered
      reaction times?
<Frozenlock> proq: How does that relate to what I've said?
<ijp> ned: there is a reason we make them retest more often
<tali713> ned: yes, by revoking their license, if you can't react fast enough
          to road conditions then you don't deserve the privilege of driving.
<ned> how do you objectively quantify who's 'fit to drive' ? id take a 25 year
      old who had 4 beers over 4 hours over a 95 year old on the road.
<proq> ned: old people have to retake the test, and eventually fail
<ned> i've never once heard of re-tests in the united states
<ned> ive lived in new york and massachusetts                           [13:39]
<ned> granted that's a tiny sample size
<ned> is this really common practice?
<tali713> yes the get quite frequent as you get old because of the reasons
          already mentioned.
<proq> Frozenlock: since when does it have to be an exact response to the last
       thing you said?
<Frozenlock> Proq: well ok then... I've eaten bacon for breakfast. Hmmmmm.
<tali713> ned: drunk driving is not about you, it is about everyone else on
          the road, driving is a privilege not a right.                 [13:40]

           reference)
<zellio> w0m: studies have shown a lot of things

<proq> zellio: the "majority" of the time there isn't a cop around observing

<tali713> ned: "I don't think i'm /that/ drunk."  "you are just saying that
          because your judgment is impaired."
<zellio> proq: driving tests should  be harder
<zellio> proq: and people should be retested more often
<w0m> I don't know anyone who got into an accident in thel ast ~4 years that a
      cellphone wasn't involved; including a couple serious ones
<zellio> proq: driver incompetance will come out no matter what

<w0m> anecdotal for sure
<fledermaus> ciao
<proq> ijp: yes, would you have to correlate the statistics with 1982 where
       drunk driving was 60% of all fatalities because more people were
       driving drunk, and it has been declining ever since

<daveo> ciao fledermaus 
<Frozenlock> proq: Suppose that we had statistics showing that men (or women)
             are worse drivers. Should we ban them from the street?
<ijp> Frozenlock: now you're just being ridiculous
<w0m> The study i recall; they setup an obstical course; and had people use a
      cellphone and run through it; to get a numerical score. They then had
      drunk people of varying levels (based on BAC) run the same course; and a
      sober person                                                      [13:45]
<w0m> (and a sober/normal person also)
<daveo> shergill: doesn't gnome-terminal != urxvt ?
<proq> zellio: that still would fail unless you figure out a way to test
       whether people can get easily distracted, and only when they don't
       *know* they're being tested
<ned> how is that ridiculous, he's being hyperbolic to get at a larger point--
      how do you objectively determine who a safe driver is and who isn't
<Frozenlock> ijp: Well If you can just find risk factor and use them to bend
             the law (pre-crime), then we must apply it. Think of the children
             for god sake!                                              [13:46]

      negligible

<shergill> daveo: yes. i'm talking of the display. i'm wondering why setting
           the same font and size is giving different appearance on the same
           machine
<ijp> that's like saying you shouldn't be allowed to drive if you've had a
      cold within the last 12 months since you might sneeze             [13:47]
<ned> he's saying 'suppose', so for the sake of argument if men were 20% more
      likely to get into fatal accidents with oncoming traffic, should they be
      banned from driving?
<wbooze> you should ban the boobs, they are attracting them!

<taylanub> Nah, in any sane lisp `lambda' is a special form that returns a
           function object, and elisp emulates that desired behavior by
           auto-quoting lambda. :P  I think it's fine to use it unquoted.
                                                                        [09:11]

<taylanub> >Implying that elisp is insane .. which it partly is if you ask me,
           but that doesn't mean I dislike it.
<fledermaus> lambda is a special form in elisp
<LooChao> haha thanks a lot.
<taylanub> emacs-w3m works fine for me.  Get the git version though.
<fledermaus> the reader treats it specially, after all                  [09:12]
<taylanub> Oh, indeed, it implements the auto-quoting by being a macro, I
           guess.
<LooChao> And I never really understand the defadvice stuff.
<taylanub> Oh ?  I'm confused now.
<fledermaus> I think the macro thing is new.
<taylanub> Aha.
<taylanub> LooChao: "Advices" are special functions that are automatically run
           when another one is run. It's so users can modify elisp functions
           without redefining them.
<LooChao> then why dont use eval-after-load?                            [09:13]

            barebones temacs executable, loads some essential elisp files such
            as this definition of all the autoloads, and then it gets dumped

<nicferrier> that's the approach I was taking. it was nearlly working before I

<taylanub> LooChao: `kbd' is a macro, so you can't pass it a variable.
<ijp> they no longer support their "downloader" on linux, so you have to do it
      thought, through their "cloud player"
<Hodapp> oh, hm, weird
<LooChao> taylanub: then what should I do?                              [16:04]
<taylanub> LooChao: I think `read-kbd-macro' works.
<jlf> taylanub: not as of 24 -- kbd is a compiled Lisp function in `subr.el'.
<tali713> taylanub: correction, kbd is a macro in emacs-23, it became a
          function in emacs-24
<taylanub> LooChao:  No wait.
<taylanub> tali713: Oh!

<jlf> ,df kbd
<fsbot> kbd is a Lisp macro in `subr.el'.
<fsbot> (kbd KEYS)
<fsbot> Convert KEYS to the internal Emacs key representation.
<fsbot> KEYS should be a string constant in the format used for
<fsbot> saving keyboard macros (see `edmacro-mode').

<taylanub> So what should LooChao use ?
<tali713> taylanub: C-x C-b

<LooChao> :D
<tali713> err C-c C-b rather. :)

<tali713> taylanub: yup, you were right.  but in the future this will not be a

<taylanub> Off I go to Lucky Star ep2.
<LooChao> taylanub: how to I let package to install the package into
          ~/Dropbox/.emacs.d/site-lisp/elpa?                            [16:41]
<tobiasBora> wgreenhouse: oh, in fact I think that when we run the export
             function, the org-mode-hook function is load... and it's not
             possible to run org preview because we are in a convert buffer !
<LooChao> since I put all the extensions into my site-lisp dir.
<taylanub> LooChao: I personally don't use package.el, someone else would know
           better.
<taylanub> Bye.
<tali713> LooChao: don't do that, that's bad.
<LooChao> tali713: then what's good to do?
<tali713> site-lisp is not for random crap you want to,,install
<fsbot> install is, like, [0] To install a <file>.el, save it to (for example)
        ~/elisp
<fsbot> [1] add to the beginning of ~/.emacs: (add-to-list 'load-path
        "~/elisp"), ..[Type ,more]
<LooChao> at least everything should inside my dropbox...
<tali713> that's fine, but not in site-lisp, site-lisp is for site-lisp.
                                                                        [16:42]
<wgreenhouse> tobiasBora: indeed, that seems to be what's happening.

<LooChao> really? site-lisp is for what?
<tali713> LooChao: I mean, you don't have to, but naming your user lisp
          directory site lisp, and then on top of that, having it be portable,
          is just awful naming.

* youlysses is either going to fix his fonts on this box, and just use my dark
  theme (which currently on this display looks horrible), or is just going to
  work on a white/light theme for it. 
<ijp> let's rewrite emacs in Joy
<technomancy> ijp: Emacs has plenty of joy as it is.
<ijp> technomancy: it would have significantly less if we used Joy though,
      ironically                                                        [16:55]

<technomancy> indeed
<wgreenhouse> youlysses: you're blaming Terminus?                       [16:56]
<tali713> capturing the feel of an old crt phosphor display is very hard to do
          as a bitmap, because physical aspects of the display lead to visual
          artifacts that simply can't be easily reproduced.             [16:57]
<ashawley> LooChao: looks like you found C-c C-b, but here's a workering
           version of your Lisp code http://paste.lisp.org/display/133605#2
<youlysses> wgreenhouse: I'm blaming the thin design for the hardness of
            reading from a-far (and my own eyes), not the video card which
            seems to be displaying everything else fine. (ex: fonts in
            conkeror).
<tali713> ashawley: nice use of backtick templates.
<wgreenhouse> youlysses: hmm.  so you are seeking perhaps a "chunkier"
              monospace font?                                           [16:58]

<anxt> tali713: yeah im married.  actually first time ive noticed like this
       though.
<wgreenhouse> LooChao: adds it to load-path so that the package's autoloads

<anxt> tali713: hmmph.
<wgreenhouse> LooChao: no, it doesn't add anything to .emacs
<LooChao> so you need I need to add the elpa path explicitly to my load-path?
<wgreenhouse> no, on Emacs 24, (package-initialize) autonomously sets up
              autoloads
<technomancy> LooChao: you can't share elpa packages across machines unless

<rudybot> tali713: we did not start anarchic, but even granting that we did.
          we move forward in time not backwards.  why would i assume that a
          political system that failed in a completely different context than
          the current is still equally likely to fail.  especially in the
          reality that there are many anarchic philosophies, only a handful of
          which are in any way primitive.  and almost all of which encourage a
          well structured society.

         list, aply function on colums, lines.. etc
<jlf> LooChao: after reading "it just adds the subdir inside ~/.emacs.d/elpa

<LooChao> technomancy: which means I just use package.el to download and

<ijp> forcer: why is that deprecated? surely that is useful in macros?
<technomancy> macrobat: usually because the package author screwed up
<forcer> ijp: You can see Stefan's reason: "Why not?" %)
<macrobat> :(
<LooChao> technomancy: but the soft did not do a stable job and error-prone
          right?
<ijp> forcer: that's a terrible reason, though
<LooChao> technomancy: I'm just new and seeking for advice :)
<ijp> let's deprecate +

<ijp> any reasonable person can just call 1+ multiple times
<forcer> ijp: Yes. His answer to that was "Welcome to life", I think. %)
<macrobat> is there an example of a package that does autoload flawlessly?
<technomancy> macrobat: just add ;;;###autoload before any form (usually a
              defun) you want autoloaded
<ijp> forcer: I know, I read it but it still doesn't make any sense to me

<aidalgol> Pseudo Old English, rather.
<tali713> getting rid of applying lambda in the first position sucks.  except.
          it doesn't work write with closures.  I suspect the avoidance of
          answering the question boils down to.  "look, with lexical binding,
          it is too damn complicated to keep maintaining this feature".
          Personally I don't care, I've always thought that if the element in
          the first position isn't bound to a function its value should be
          used instead.

             enforce evaluation order
<ijp> check out my leet abacus skills
<tali713> why bother with grouping when you can simply write one expression
          over another in a fraction. (or was that division?)           [14:58]
<ijp> EddieSputz: which basically every non-trivial expression does anyway
<nicferrier> but when you change the language used to represent it it changes
             the way people think about it. and suddenly it was accessible.
<tali713> and ratios can be written in only 3 or 4 different ways.

<tali713> and yet, for some reason RPN/RPL calculators work fine and are very
          popular... so, why is algebraic notation better for numerical

<ijp> anyway, my view of infix is quite simple. As a critique of lisp, it is
      overused. Most mathematical expressions your average programmer writes
      aren't complicated.
<ijp> For heavy mathematical stuff, knock yourself out, you deserve a dsl.
<JordiGH> Oh noes, mathematics has syntax, let's make school children learn
          lisp instead.
*** konr_trab (~user@177.32.249.211) has joined channel #emacs
<tali713> JordiGH: not the point.  algebraic notation is great.  it is not

<nicferrier> ijp is just following my point (and therefore is right).
<ijp> just so :)
<anxt> i think the notation that most clearly helps you think about something,
       or communicate it to others is great.
<nicferrier> just because infix is good for maths doesn't mean it makes
             programming simpler.
<nicferrier> in fact lisp's syntax works better in the context of programming
                                                                        [15:01]

<ijp> yes, you've said
<turbofail> nothing could sell you on lisp, because all the things we like

<tali713> I'm teasing, diagrams can be useful.  explanatory UML is alright.
          UML as a way to design a program starts moving into the territory of
          "write a program so that you can then write a program", my same

<tali713> damd: it isn't fundamentally bad.  but, it bothers me, on account
          of, if you know what your program is going to do, and can write
          tests to make sure it does it, that are sufficiently correct,
          haven't you just written a program, albeit in a specification style.
          TDD, as a way of preventing regression, totally fine.  but again,
          why not make your earlier implementation the backbone of the tests.
          or if tests are so much easier than                           [17:27]
<tali713> implementation, why not make a language where defining sufficient
          tests /is/ implementation. etc.
<anxt> i just associate {"UML", "software engineering", "clean code", and
       "TDD"} in the same group.
<anxt> not that any of those things are bad :)
<tali713> damd: I'm not anti-TDD, it certainly has uses.  But the fact that it
          has uses, is iteself a sign of another problem. (IMO)         [17:28]
<damd> tali713: i see your point... just curious, do you have any methodology
       which you prefer to implement in your projects?

<damd> jlf: TDD can also help you better understand what you're actually
       trying to accomplish
<forcer> I recently read a pretty interesting article on "design for testing".
<jlf> damd: that's just what i meant
<tali713> damd: well, when I explain it, most people tend to say, oh, but
          that's just a variant of TDD, etc.  I like and can read lisp, so I
          write my diagram, program specification, notes on development, and
          implement in lisp.  which are all identical.  but I might choose a
          slow bad correct implementation for a function.  which I then make
          the basis of a test for the next iteration.                   [17:30]
<forcer> tdd seems to be "take a good idea and take it too far", though
<tali713> (that is, all such tasks are written in the same language, so by the
          time I am done deciding how I want to specify, I am also, almost

<aidalgol> I'm trying to byte-compile elnode, but I get a lot of errors.
                                                                        [17:47]
<mbriggs> bpalmer: ugh, i was hoping for like (yield-to-next-binding) or
          something :(
<technomancy> jao: does it include a way to browse racket's introductory docs
              (not just docstrings etc) or would that be done better via info
              or something?                                             [17:48]
<mbriggs> bpalmer: thanks though

<nicferrier> it'll still work.
<aidalgol> Yeah, I'll just skip precompiling it. :P
<technomancy> oops; lost my connection there. did I miss an answer to my
              question about introductory docs?
<nicferrier> aidalgol: just use the package?
<nicferrier> aidalgol: hmmm. no I get what you're doing.                [17:49]
<jao> technomancy, you can jump from the help to the manual, or directly to
      the manual entry of a symbol in the buffer.  for systematic browsing of
      the racket tutorials, conkeror would work better
<aidalgol> nicferrier: huh?
<nicferrier> aidalgol: I just eval the indvidual files.
<aidalgol> You mean compile?
<jao> technomancy, as far as i know, racket's docs are not available in info

<wgreenhouse> xiang_wang: my favorites are the emacs24 themes `solarized-dark'
              and `tron'.  I also often use Emacs with no theme at all, just
              using ~/.Xresources to achieve a look similar to how my terminal
              emulators are colored.
<Rakko> I like ir_gray                                                  [00:08]

              http://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs.  follow the
              directions in the comments of solarized-theme.el to install
<wgreenhouse> you can also get it as a package for the "Marmalade" package.el
              repository.                                               [00:12]
<wgreenhouse> once it's installed and in custom-theme-load-path, you can just
              evaluate (load-theme 'solarized-dark)                     [00:13]

<wgreenhouse> xiang_wang: it will not always ask you, just the first time.
              and I don't think you really want to ignore it. themes can
              change any setting that the customize interface can change,
              i.e. much more than just colors.

<HedgeMage> If emacs is making my window split horizontally and I'd prefer a
            vertical split, what is an easy way to switch without switching my
            config (i.e. I want it switched now but not forever)        [01:55]

<HedgeMage> elkng: that took me from a two-way split to a three-way split
<quotemstr> #emacs, what's the fastest way to test that a buffer contains all
            zero bytes?
* HedgeMage doesn't use splits often and is a tad confused
<HedgeMage> nevermind, I figured it out :)                              [02:01]

<elkng> is there a way to exchange frame's positions ?
<elkng> in splitted set of frames 
<elkng> are they called "frames" or "windows" ? isnt frames are ones that GUI
        creates ?                                                       [02:06]
<rcfox> I think a "frame" is what modern people would call a "window"
<rcfox> A window is a subsection of a frame.
*** Tegi_ (~Tegi@113.172.52.103) has joined channel #emacs              [02:08]
<elkng> when we say frame, we mean a separate GUI window. When we say window,
        we mean a portion of the current Emacs display

<elkng> "GUI windows are not Emacs windows. Emacs calls GUI windows frames. In
        part, this terminology is necessary because Emacs predates GUIs and is
        still often used on terminals without GUI windows. Emacs windows are

<TTilus> and of course a non-gui "window" is also a frame
<Rakko> and in some window systems even little things like buttons and

<jlf> np
<Drakeson> elkng: you know you can type C-o in ibuffer to open the buffer in a
           window, right?
<doomlord> suggestoins for elisp core, or questions about what can& can't be
           retrofitted. I'm a fan of lisp-1 and clojure. If any more of this
           can be retrofitted to elisp non-destrucively that would be
           nice. IMO the 'funcallable objects' in clojure are awesome and go a
           long way to making lisp fell much less clunky.. clojure is really
           good at dealing with adhoc datastructures                    [10:23]

<doomlord> I heard there is an existing lisp1 emacs project (guile/scheme) and
           that lisp1 ideas have been discussed.
<Drakeson> doomlord: there are many proposals to improve / replace emacs lisp.
           A major problem is porting the enormous jungle of already written
           elisp.                                                       [10:26]
<doomlord> sure; thats why i ask if there's discussion on what can be done
           *non destructively*. i dont think replacing elisp is needed
<bitonic> doomlord: well you can build extensions, a new and notable one is
          lexical scoping
<bitonic> but you can't do that much                                    [10:27]
<bitonic> while maintaining a fairly homogeneous environment
<aaptel> also maintainers have the final word
<doomlord> dynamic->lexical scope sounds like a fairly destructive change :)
                                                                        [10:28]
<aaptel> see: the cl debacle
<Drakeson> doomlord: note that the guile/scheme one has the benefit of being
           part of the gnu project so it will get the political support (like
           what bzr got in the face of git), but porting old elisp still
           remains a huge problem.  It is apparently capable of running both
           elisp and guile (scheme).
<bitonic> doomlord: what things exactly would you like to see?  the lisp-1/2
          thing does not bring great advantages so people are probably not
          going to bother                                               [10:29]
<bitonic> while lexical scoping is a huge win
*** lduros (~user@fsf/member/lduros) has joined channel #emacs          [10:31]
<taylanub> What's a destructive change ?
<doomlord> my favourite 2 things in clojure:  (i) funcallable  objects: so you
           can say (mywin :width) instead of (window-width mywin) - perhaps
           its possible to hard-code an interface to intrinsic emacs objects
           (windows,frames,buffers) that 'feels' like clojure objects;  [2]
           literal maps { :foo 10 :bar 20 }  ..together with funcallable
           objects , they make clojure coding more pleasant than other lisps
           IMO. From my limited exposure 
<doomlord> to lisps I support the claim that clojure is a 'modern lisp' .
<doomlord> "destructive change" = one that breaks existing elisp code.  [10:32]
*** sjihs (~arch@117.202.20.146) has quit: Quit: Konversation terminated!
<doomlord> overall i like emacs :)
<bitonic> doomlord: they both seem cosmetic issues, and you can probably get
          very close with macros.                                       [10:33]
<taylanub> I didn't read the context, but I'm not aware of any plans for
           backwards-incompatible elisp changes from anyone.  Lexical binding
           has already been incorporated compatibly, and guile just implements
           the elisp we all know.
*** palomer (~jlen@bas1-montreal47-1177983598.dsl.bell.ca) has joined channel
    #emacs
<doomlord> clojure's lambda sugar is pretty useful too, but uses the #(...)
           syntax, that might already be something else. i know lisp purists
           hate it.                                                     [10:34]
<taylanub> Scheme uses #() for vectors.
<elkng> Drakeson: I'm reading book about emacs and in chapter about buffers at
        the end it has table that summarizes the commands for working with the
        buffer list and there is no "C-o" the commans that can open content of
        a buffer "o","v","1",2","f", but not 
<elkng>  "C-o", strange, that why I thought there is not such behaviour, but
        then actually I found "C-o" in the text before that table
<bitonic> doomlord: yeah but this is all sugar - not a big deal         [10:35]
<doomlord> yeah; whereas elisp and some lispss have [...]    
<bitonic> you'll get used to it
<taylanub> By the way, SRFI-105 has been accepted, and guile implements it.
<taylanub> {{foo{- bar} + baz(bat)} and quux(derp)}  ->  (and (+ (foo (- bar))
           (baz bat)) (quux derp))                                      [10:36]
<doomlord> i'm not a long time lispp coder; my opinions aer from a 'c/c++
           head'. Most people i know IRL balk at the concept of any lisp :)
<doomlord> whats that  -  a different use of { ...} ?                   [10:37]
<doomlord> INFIX?!
<taylanub> There wasn't any other in Scheme so far AFAIK, except maybe some
           implementation's own things.
<taylanub> Yes, infix.
<doomlord> eeew. see that goes against the spirit of lisp IMO.
<taylanub> Haha, it doesn't. :D
<taylanub> You might want to read the SRFI.
<taylanub> (Well, what's the "lisp spirit" ?)                           [10:38]
<doomlord> trivial to parse
*** rend (~rend@unaffiliated/rend) has quit: Quit: leaving
<taylanub> I don't think it's about the simplicity of the parser as much as it

<doomlord> the two are linked
<taylanub> Then the above would be "simple."
<taylanub> Since it retains homoiconicity.                              [10:39]
<doomlord> its simple to parse because there isn't much between sourcecode and
           the internal representation

<taylanub> Possibly.  Not sure if it mixes with plain s-expressions as good as
           SRFI-105 does though.
<taylanub> BTW I want [foo | bar] for ((foo) bar). :P                   [10:41]
<taylanub> But pipes will now be used for symbols .. oh well.
<taylanub> We should start using unicode.  (foo  bar).
<Drakeson> doomlord: Clojure IS a modern lisp, and it is well engineered.
           Even with the compromises it had to do for java interop.  There are
           many cosmetic and small fixes, too.  Sometimes I find it tormenting
           to write any elisp or even common-lisp after writing large chunks
           of code in clojure.  But still, it is hard to make real changes to
           elisp, so we are stuck with it!                              [10:42]

<cluck> FOR THE LAST TIME: guile scheme ISN'T going to replace elisp, all

<Hodapp> foz: "better"?
<elkng> Drakeson: any sample to compare tormenting writing in "elisp" and
        "common-lisp" with "clojure" ?
<doomlord> I much prefer emacs to vim                                   [10:44]
<foz> why?
<taylanub> foz: Obviously people in here will prefer emacs.  People in #vim
           will prefer vim.
<foz> well i don't know emacs, and i've been using vim, but I feel my
      education is lacking because i wasn't given a choice
<taylanub> There's many reasons to prefer either, and you're probably better
           off trying them yourself.  However, some people are into emacs due
           to the whole lisp VM thing.  Like me.  (Although I've also come to
           love the emacs way of editing instead of modal editing.)     [10:45]

<taylanub> Insert mode, command mode.
<Drakeson> elkng: {:foo bar} instead of make-hash-table, setf ?   Having easy
           (both syntax and underlying thread safety) hash tables makes a huge
           difference.  Concurrency, too.

<foz> the thing i dont like about vim is when i have a run-on-line and i can't
      move up and down the line like 'on the screen' i have to move along the
      line structure
<doomlord> emacs has a crazy keylout out of the box ... but can be modifie
<taylanub> You're supposed to enter insert mode only for short periods of
           time.
<foz> how do i start learning emacs?
<taylanub> C-h t
<taylanub> That is, start emacs, then hit Ctrl+H then T.
<taylanub> (Starts the tutorial.)                                       [10:47]
<doomlord> foz: i used to enjoy "brief" & codewrite for c programming - I
           found emacs can emulate their windowing which is awesome -
           "windmove" - better than bookmarks etc in an idea- quick hotkeys to
           navigate a tiled window setup, with cursor key bindings to move
           between them. This is really helpful
<elkng> doomlord: someone said one can use "C-o" to run one command without
        changing to command mode and back                               [10:48]
<foz> theres so much to learn
<doomlord> foz: i went the route of just remapping everything. look for "ergo
           emacs". i think the default bindings are a bit crazy. but, being
           extra-prefixed, they leave many simple bindings open for whatever
           you want
<doomlord> elkng : maybe, but VIM lost me already
<taylanub> How do I get a specific entry number from fsbot ?            [10:49]
<doomlord> the fact there is even a command mode is offputing :)
<Drakeson> foz: vim offers far saner keybinding for navigation.  That's about
           it.  Emacs offers a highly flexible programmable environment that
           you can bend to your needs.
<doomlord> emacs can be given whatever bindings you want
<doomlord> i have it with familiar CUA,  C-o open C-f find C-s save , etc etc
                                                                        [10:50]
<foz> what is elisp then?
<doomlord> for writing plugins/libraries whatever they're called
<taylanub> The programming language in which most of emacs is written.
<taylanub> And you can redefine functions in it etc. while using emacs and it
           will take effect immediately.
<taylanub> Also, every keypress in emacs runs an elisp function.

*** Atlas_ (~Atlas@209.189.245.40) has joined channel #emacs
<taylanub> By the way one can start emacs like "emacs --daemon" and then
           connect with "emacsclient" both from a terminal and by opening a
           GUI window, or just evaluate elisp code like "emacsclient -e
           'foobar'"
<doomlord> i dont even know what you'd have to do to vim to make it
           sane... emacs, i've made it do a combinations of things i can't do
           in other editors that i've always wanted
<elkng> foz: so far the only difference is I use is instead of "C-a" to go to
        begining of a line I use "C-a a"
<doomlord> foz: i am finding emacs works very well both fullscreen and with
           many smaller frames                                          [10:53]
<Drakeson> foz: there is also a mildly better alternative to running emacs in
           screen; you can run "emacs --daemon" first (e.g. on the remote host
           if that is why you want it under screen), and then use emacsclient
           which gives you emacs sessions very quickly.
<doomlord> depending on my mood
<yates> ,criminalp bremner
<fsbot> nil  ..(symbol)
<elkng> wait, one can run "emacs --daemon" and "emacsclient -t" on different
        PC ?                                                            [10:54]
* Drakeson was beaten by taylanub to it.
<taylanub> You can actually run a terminal emulator inside emacs, so
           screen/tmux aren't really necessary.
<doomlord> cosmetic enhancement: elisp should adopt scheme-like aliases for
           predicate functions symbol? etc.. those are very readable :)
<Drakeson> elkng: no
<elkng> no ?
<doomlord> heh. editor wars, i have joined the emacs front. VIM is an
           abomination that should be purged                            [10:55]
<elkng> its not working the way X and X-applications work ?
<doomlord> i pledge alleigance to the emacs cause.
<taylanub> I only use tmux 1) to run rtorrent, because for weird reasons it
           caused weird problems in the emacs terminal emulator, 2)
           emacsclient has a bug where if you connect through ssh and run
           emacsclient, and the ssh connection dies and kills emacsclient, the
           whole emacs daemon might crash.
<elkng> also vim is annoyed everyone with charity stuff
<Drakeson> What I meant is that if your purpose of running emacs under screen
           is attaching and detaching to your emacs on remote, you can do it
           just as well using emacsclient.  In both cases you ssh to the
           remote machine, of course.

<doomlord> but is VIM lighter than emacs ?
<taylanub> The default installation, for sure.
<elkng> taylanub: that why screen was invented
<taylanub> elkng: But emacsclient should make it unnecessary. -_-
<elkng> taylanub: if ssh crashes all programms are safe in screen session
<taylanub> Yet, emacsclient dies -> emacs daemon dies.

<Urchin> screen is an ok universal solution to keeping stuff running
<Drakeson> taylanub: screen has a lower chance of crashing, so it is still
           perfectly sane to run things under screen.
<taylanub> Yeah.  Emacsclient really shouldn't bring down the daemon

<doomlord> any hints from elispers on implementing a filebrowser - i've still

<doomlord> can you give a buffer a pair of "update" and "render" functions
           perhaps ..
*** kmicu (~kmicu@79.110.197.218) has quit: Remote host closed the connection
<forcer> Sounds like you want a dedicated buffer and a major mode for it.
*** hansy (~hansy@190.235.89.36) has quit: Quit: Leaving
<forcer> You put stuff to display in a buffer as text. You can use text
         properties and/or overlays (see manual) to highlight stuff.
<doomlord> cursor / snapping to columns - really this would have a cell
           position and i'd want <- -> cursor keys to move the whole
           highlight; would i use an "overlay" for the highlight, or-re-render
           parts of the buffer..                                        [11:05]

<zygew> is it possible to disable statue bar on emacs,which is tooo big on my

<offby1> So ... in *shell*, when I run a command that prompts for a password,
         Emacs properly notices and diverts my input to the minibuffer (and
         properly displays stars as I type, to obscure the password).  But:
         After I hit Enter, the prompt is still present in the minibuffer, and
         I have to hit C-g to make it go away.  What gives?

<attila_lendvai> hi! is there a weird difference between M-x goto-char and
                 calling it from inside a command? I print the position in a
                 (message ...) and if I M-x goto-char to it, then it's the
                 right position, but the (goto-char ...) call inside moves me
                 to a position somewhere halfway only, and I have no idea
                 what's happening...

<ashawley> yes, `nreverse' is fine for what i'm doing.
<tali713> right.  hence my suggestion that you should save it for lists you
          are constructing.  in which case it makes perfect sense to
          accumulate with cons and finally nreverse.                    [16:08]
<Loplin> jlf: right, but I'm trying to see if anything at all is bound to the
         windows key, not just alt-tab. In case there is anything at all that
         is intercepting it.
<ashawley> just seems it shouldn't work with out using setq
<Loplin> jlf: or rather, not just win+tab
<jlf> you can't bind anything to a modifer. 
<jlf> or even a modifier
<tali713> ashawley: you are destructively reversing the list, the reference to
          the list is still pointing where it should.

<tali713> I /believe/ the key with the little divided square on it is usually
          a modifier.  but if you are in windows it is almost certainly being

<jlf> ashawley: even better, "3.9 Truth and Falsehood in Emacs Lisp
      ===================================== There is an important aspect to
      the truth test in an `if' expression. So far, we have spoken of `true'
      and `false' as values of predicates as if they were new kinds of Emacs
      Lisp objects.  In fact, `false' is just our old friend `nil'.  Anything
      else--anything at all--is `true'."
<LooChao> I was trying (string-match ".*[dD]ired.*" major-mode)
<technomancy> more like your old foe nil
<jlf> which he could have found with a quick C-s truth RET RET

<LooChao> question about autoload
<LooChao> Magic
<LooChao> comments are the most convenient way to make a function autoload,
          for
<LooChao> packages installed along with Emacs.  These comments do nothing on
<LooChao> their own, but they serve as a guide for the command
<LooChao> `update-file-autoloads', which constructs calls to `autoload' and
<LooChao> arranges to execute them when Emacs is built.

<LooChao> (require 'evil) can be replaced (autoload 'evil "evil.el")?   [18:43]

<forcer> youlysses: Figure out where you want to be when you're 30 :-D

<fsbot> Open a TCP connection to HOST, optionally with encryption. ..[Type

<yates> youlysses: well don't do anything rash, and celebrate yourself - i'm
        sure you have lots to be thankful for
<jlf> Ener2: and ,,df set-process-filter
<fsbot> set-process-filter is a built-in function in `process.c'.       [16:10]
<fsbot> (set-process-filter PROCESS FILTER)
<fsbot> Give PROCESS the filter function FILTER; nil means no filter.

<yates> forcer: good point
<Ener2> I have never used emacs before although I used the emacs like key

<yates> Ener2: then i think you can use slime under emacs

      from emacs with M-x slime-connect                                 [16:12]
<youlysses> yates: forcer: I'm just glad I can tell I'm finally starting to

<yates> glad you're overcoming it.                                      [16:13]
<Ener2> its full blow engine which is running lisp 
<shergill> hmm 16-17. that was the last time i felt that sense of being lost
           and wondering what i wanted to do etc. it was about then that i
           decided that all i needed to do was to optimize for happiness
<jlf> Ener2: load swank.lisp into it
<Ener2> I do have tcp server which is running toplevel though
<Ener2> jlf: will try then
<jlf> Ener2: swank.lisp will handle the tcp server
<youlysses> yates: This past week or-so it *really* has. That being said, I'm
            pretty sure (and this was even before the "funk") that I need my

<Ener2> jlf: okay
<Ener2> there is actually swank-ecl.lisp
<shergill> i guess, i've sense felt bored/despondent at times
<Ener2> I think I should get that one, right?

<jlf> Ener2: i don't know ecl.  maybe try #lisp.

<fsbot> swank is, like, the protocol used by slime to communicate with the
        inferior lisp (see ,slime).
<jlf> Ener2: if you're using CL you almost certainly want slime/swank.  
<yates> http://paste.lisp.org/display/133727
<yates> just replace clisp with ecl? 
<Ener2> jlf: we use in school lispworks, but that is terrible actually
<yates> Ener2: ^^^^                                                     [16:18]
<Ener2> so I want to switch to something else for my private projects so yeah
<Ener2> do I need whole slime?
<yates> Ener2: why do you care? just install it.
<yates> (ql:install slime)?
<jlf> Ener2: best to do some web research about it
<yates> (ql:install 'slime)?
<daimrod> Ener2: if you install slime - and you really want it if you do CL -
          install it with Quicklisp.                                    [16:19]
<yates> yeah, that too
<Ener2> I can get it off my repo
<yates> you can get it directly from Zack's site.

<tali713> err shoes-off.
<tali713> sorry, I'm just getting my brain caffeinated.
<nicferrier> oh right. you should have said. although my focus is mainly
             teamchat there is possibly stuff I could do to make it easier.
                                                                        [13:37]
<nicferrier> I think a shoes-off/elnode combo is a good combo for
             bouncers. not just teamchat. I should really just combine it and
             make an easily installable thing.
<nicferrier> testing irc bouncers is quite hard.
<tali713> yeah, I think I planned to, but then got distracted by other things.
          I know it is primarilly for teamchat, but it would be nice to have a
          super configurable emacs based bouncer.                       [13:38]

<wgreenhouse> I'm not a death penalty supporter in general, but there ought to

<rryoumaa> sometimes you don't want to stop a program to redirect
<wgreenhouse> compilation-mode seems pretty okay at handling gobs of output,

          calculations, calculate sub parts of a function separately and.

<twb> M-x shell does it by watching for the word "cd foo", so if you do

<Attic> Yes
<twb> Hm, that is surprising

              not code, regular plain english text. When I use the text though

<taylanub> Hrm wait a minute, I'm having second thoughts.  In the case of for
           (var i = 0; i < n; ++i) {} it actually makes sense for all
           iterations to refer to the same i.  ObjC blocks seem to do magic
           and copy the variable's momentary value unless it has been declared
           with __block to enable lexical scoping.  It seems to behave like JS
           when lexical scoping is enabled. :|                          [06:02]

<taylanub> I'd say that, in the case of for (var i = 0; i < n; ++i) {}, the
           programmer explicitly specifies the change applied to `i' *between*
           iterations of the body, so it's clear that the variable exists in a
           scope that encloses the body, but with for (var i in array) {},
           it's unclear and one would assume it to be a fresh variable each
           time since it's entirely inaccessible outside of each body.
<leth> quotemstr: it's not unmatched if you haven't gone through the rest of
       the file.

<Naeblis> Hi. I'm an emacs newbie. Currently, I have (global-linum-mode) in my
          .emacs to display line numbers, but there's zero space b/w the line
          no. and the text. How can I change that?                      [08:46]

<bremner> rudybot: the subjunctive is hard, let's go shopping.
<rudybot> bremner: It's annoying when Spanish and French don't agree on how to
          use tenses, though. I sound like a fool in French when I try to use
          French tenses like in Spanish. They usually disagree on the

<tali713> bottom line there is library called cl, a few of the functions in it
          do not do what their cl counterparts too and thus have misleading
          names, they are deprecated.  which /is/ the warning that it is time
          to reimplement them elsewhere.  also they tend to rely on dynamic
          binding being default, while most of elisp is going towards lexical
          binding.  so if you want elisp-flet, now would be a good time to
          write it.  with the clear                                     [14:04]
<tali713> understanding that it is not and never has been cl. (even if it

<nicferrier> it's stupid and tali713's argument is silly I think. flet may be
             broken for common-lisp comparisons but lots of cl isn't
             common-lisp.

        emacs has defuns to switch text case at will?!
<tali713> yup, and it is built in and highly configurable

<nicferrier> please don't call this panic. flet is being removed. the
             expectation is that it will be removed the same way aget was.
                                                                        [15:07]

<markdaws> hi - when I start emacs it loads the *GNU EMacs* buffer in
           Fundamental mode, I was to enable the minor mode "projectile" I can
           do this manually by running M-x projectile-mode but I want to do it
           automatically on load, I tried to a bunch of differnt things in my
           .emacs file but I can't seem to auto run this command, any
           pointers?  Thanks
<juri_> they even managed to get verizon to install DSL service here.. which
        verizon has broken every way they can, and still call it 'internet'.
<wgreenhouse> nicferrier: I doubt if my aid is worth it :)
<wgreenhouse> nicferrier: but thanks, I'll keep that in mind            [17:50]
<fsmunoz> All things said and done SDF is a good place. I would actually like
          if more people around here would join there, would help in that
          sense of community that I think is lacking today, sharing shell
          hosts kind of reminds me of BBSs ;=)
<pessoa> lexically scoped elisp or the good old dynamically scoped?
<nicferrier> wgreenhouse: it'll take me 2seconds and an ssh key
<fsmunoz> lexical scope is anke oil!

<nounch2> personally, i consider install instructions to be part of the
          general interface of software (just like docs)
<wgreenhouse> and thus the lack of "manual" installation instructions is an
              oversight.  a problematic one, I agree

<wgreenhouse> ah, good
<yates> is there a package that provides a "position stack" - like something
        that allows you to push your current position, go somewhere else, push
        that position, go yet another place, then pop back to the original
        position?
<yates> (pop twice)
<yates> and please don't tell me how easy it would be to write my own..
<nounch2> in fact, it isn't too easy to write your own (just think about
          deleting hunks between jumps)                                 [21:29]
<yates> i actually already have a one-level stack (via registers) but i was

<fsbot> Asking questions such as, "Does anyone know/use X?", makes it hard for
        us to know what you're really looking for. Try asking a more directed
        question. (If no one answers, it doesn't mean we're ignoring you.)
