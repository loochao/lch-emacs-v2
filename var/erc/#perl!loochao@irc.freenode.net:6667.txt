<LooChao> silly questions: how to call a system process?
<LooChao> system(ls)?
<LooChao> `ls`?
<huf> depends on what you want to do with it
<huf> so, what do you want to do with it?
<LooChao> want to learn how many ways to call a system command.         [14:34]
<LooChao> Newbie, still learning.
<huf> oh. well, system() and `` both call it, but they do very different
      things
<mst> LooChao: I tend to use http://p3rl.org/IPC::System::Simple
<mst> LooChao: or if I want to leave it running in the background,
      http://p3rl.org/Proc::Simple

<jjore> I've really enjoyed IPC::Run, especially given the flexibility on
        choosing what to do WRT redirections.

*** pj-phone (~pj-phone@60-234-254-5.bitstream.orcon.net.nz) has joined

<haarg> and hopefully you are doing something other than calling ls, because

<huf> LooChao: system() calls it so it inherits your stdin/stdout/stderr, and
      returns the exit code of the program. `` is popen, it calls the thing
      and captures its stdout, returning that to you once the process is done.
                                                                        [14:38]

<LooChao> I just tried.

<LooChao> cat test.pl
<LooChao> if it's system('ls')                                          [14:40]
<LooChao> it's like calling ls from the command line.
<LooChao> but if it's `ls`
<LooChao> no output to the command line.
<mst> correct. because `ls` *returns* the output
<LooChao> my question is what does `ls` do?
<jjore> That part where I wrote $var = `ls` meant it went into $var.    [14:41]
<LooChao> `ls` returns? where?
<huf> same thing as `ls` does in shell, basically

<mauke> LooChao: wherever you wrote it
<huf> LooChao: it's an expression, when evaluated, it yields a value
<huf> that value is the output of the program you called
<LooChao> huf: I see. which means use the output to replace `ls`
<huf> well, "replace"
<huf> not really replace. it returns the output
<LooChao> but system('ls') also returns the output?                     [14:42]
<huf> no, it returns the exit code
<huf> the output is printed by ls to its stdout
<huf> which happens to be your script's stdout
<huf> so you just see it on your terminal
<stan___> system would return the output before the program exists because it
          takes your stdin/out/err `` must wait for the program to exit/return
          before it can display output                                  [14:43]
<LooChao> huf: thanks, now it's clear
<huf> system does not return any output, stan___
<LooChao> $var = system('ls')
<stan___> well i was trying to put it in lamerns terms
<LooChao> after calling $var ==0
<LooChao> but the stdout will have ls output
<LooChao> while `ls`
<LooChao> $var = `ls`                                                   [14:44]

<huf> LooChao: yes, similar to how in shell: ls ; echo $? will print ls's
      output and then echo 0, ls's exit code
<eam> LooChao: if you are familiar with system libraries, `` is akin to
      popen()
<LooChao> $var will be the output of ls

<Kovensky> mst: yeah, but I had used cpan to update a lot of core modules
<mst> Kovensky: all I can suggest is that you've installed cpan versions of a
      bunch of dual life stuff
<mst> right
<mst> at which point fatpacker has to bundle them
<mst> because it has no way of telling if you need the updated versions or not
<Kovensky> I see                                                        [15:20]

<Kovensky> I thought it'd filter against corelist or sth, but whatever  [15:21]
<Kovensky> you're probably doing the right thing
<mst> how would that help?
*** fgomez (~Fernando@uws16915usr.uws.ualberta.ca) has joined channel #perl
*** Shiina (~Shiina@unaffiliated/shiina) has joined channel #perl
<mst> e.g. if core contains JSON::PP 2.2 and you';ve installed 2.3 from CPAN
<mst> fatpacker can either (a) bundle 2.3, which might be wasteful or (b) not
      bundle it, and then your code turns out to crash against 2.2      [15:22]
<mst> I chose option (a) because I prefer things to not crash :)
<Kovensky> :)
<Kovensky> at any rate, I ended up not using fatpack because the people who
           would use my code didn't want a single huge file ._.
<mauke> besides, it's called *fat*packer
<Kovensky> instead I copied modules into a lib/ dir and had the script load
           them from there
<tadzik> did anyone try this carton thingy?                             [15:23]
<mauke> Kovensky: fatpacker + multifile zip!
<mst> tadzik: carton's a way to build a per-app local::lib
<Kovensky> (similar to what fatpack tree would've done, actually, but I only
           needed a single module)
<tadzik> I think it was something that was to solve this kind of problem
<tadzik> mst: is it any good?
<mst> tadzik: it's marginally easier than doing it by hand
<Kovensky> tadzik: isn't it like a perl version of `bundler`?
<tadzik> Kovensky: no eye deer
<tadzik> not that I know what bundler is, either                        [15:24]
*** neersighted (neer@is.a.slave.to.neersighted.com) has joined channel #perl
<Kovensky> ruby's version of bundler records in a file the version of
           dependency modules that were used during development
<mst> tadzik: it's a nasty hack, frankly, but one that is very easy to use so
      long as it doesn't break
<Kovensky> so, on deployment, you can replicate the development environment by
           using `bundler` to install the exact same versions you had
<mst> tadzik: but, equally, the same can be said of cpanm               [15:25]
<mst> tadzik: so that's not necessarily a criticism :)
